        <h2>What is Belly Button?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p id="p-context">Your belly button marks the spot where your umbilical (say: um-BIL-ih-kul) cord
          was once attached. This cord
          is a soft, bendable tube that carried nutrients — vitamins and minerals — from your mother to you, back when
          you were in her belly (womb) (KidsHealth Medical Experts, Why Do I Have a Belly Button? (for Kids) - Nemours
          KidsHealth).</p>
        <p id="p-context">Your navel is technically named the umbilicus and is commonly called the “belly
          button.” All humans have
          them. Other mammals have them as well, although theirs are usually smooth or flat—often just a thin line
          hidden by fur (Kimberly Dumke, Belly Button Biodiversity 2013).</p>

        <h2>Belly Button Biodiversity</h2>
        <hr>
        <p id="p-context">In 2011, a team of scientists launched the Belly Button Biodiversity Project to
          find out. These scientists were from the biology department of North Carolina State University (NC State)
          and the Nature Research Center (NRC) at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p id="p-context">The research team discovered that belly buttons are very diverse habitats! In total, they
          discovered 2,368 different species. More than half of those may be new to science. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p id="p-context">The researchers found that the average belly button among study participants contains 67
          different phylotypes of bacteria. And many of those bacteria were quite unexpected – including some normally
          found only in marine environments or in foreign soils.</p>
        <p id="p-context">Making connections such as these could help shed light on the ties between our bacterial hosts
          and their effects on health. Researchers believe that microbes—not just in the belly button but in every nook
          and cranny of the human body—are involved in everything from immune function to acne to skin softness. The
          potential boon to medicine is enormous but out of reach until scientists can clarify what the microbes are
          doing in the first place, and why they're there.</p>
